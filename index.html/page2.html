      Hey pretty boy, how are you? <br>
      I hope you're better now. <br><br>
      I just wanted to say thank you for being the best boyfriend ever. <br><br>
      You mean so much to me and you always make me smile. <br>
      Thank you for always being there for me and loving me even at times when I'm hard to love. <br><br>
      Thank you for never letting me sleep feeling sad and never making me feel like my feelings are invalid even though you're super busy. <br><br>
      Thank you for loving me genuinely and always reassuring me. <br><br>
      I love you so much, I'm really glad we met. <br>
      I know I am really bad at expressing my love through words irl but I try. It's just I feel shy around you. <br>
      You really are the best boyfriend ever. <br><br>
      I hope we get to spend rest of our life together happily. <br>
      I wanna travel with you, eat good food, buy stuff for you (with totally my money not my dadâ€™s). <br><br>
      Thank you for being patient with me even though I'm a bitch at times. <br>
      Even though you said you're not good with emotions, I think you are really good with them lol. <br><br>
      Anyways, I love you sooooooooooooooooooo much mwah mwah mwah ðŸ’•
